# knowtilus

A cross-platform app, built using Flutter, that succinctly consolidates fundamental knowledge for coastal navigation.

## State

The project is still in development.
Most of the work is done,for some code cleaning and refactoring is needed.

The app is made using flutter and GETX for easier widget state management.
