# knowtilus

A cross-platform app, built using Flutter, that succinctly consolidates fundamental knowledge for coastal navigation.

## State

The project is still in development.
Most of the work is done, some code cleaning and refactoring is needed.

The app is made using flutter and GETX for easier widget state management.

When the project reach beta, the app will be published for free in the Playstore, in F-Droid, and as a static web-app.

When the app is fully ready, the goal is also to publish it in the App Store and Playstore at a low price.

Translations English and French for the moment, in lib/translations/ktranslation.dart
